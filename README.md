Welcome!

This is my first data analytics project.

Steps:
    Download data. There were too many data files to download by hand so I wrote a Python script to do it: downloader.py. I tried on-line solutions with wget, but none worked, so I wrote custom code. If you want to use it you'll need to change the path variables to your local path and website you're downloading from.

    downloader.py downloads most of the files for you, but leaves a few to download by hand.
