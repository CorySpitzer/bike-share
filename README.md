Welcome!

This is my first data analytics project.

Steps:
    Download data. There were to many data files to download by hand so I wrote a Python script to do it: downloader.py. I tried on-line solutions with wget, but none worked, so I wrote custom code. If you want to use it you'll need to change the path variables to your local path and website you're downloading from.
